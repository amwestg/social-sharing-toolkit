This plugin enables sharing of your content via popular social networks and can convert Twitter names and hashtags to links. Easy & configurable.

== Description ==

The plugin currently supports the following networks:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google +1
* LinkedIn
* Tumblr
* StumbleUpon
* Digg
* Reddit
* MySpace
* Hyves (a social network especially popular in the Netherlands). 

You can decide which networks to support on your blog and where the buttons will appear (either above or below the content). You can also choose between different layouts; small without counters, wide with counters or high with counters. Be aware that not every network has a dedicated button for every layout.

= Shortcode =

It is also possible to only let the buttons appear where you want by using shortcode. To do this you need to set the button position to the shortcode option and use the shortcode [social_share/] in the content where you would like to display the buttons.

= Styling =

The plugin uses a list to position the buttons. You can easily change the css to match your blog style by changing the css file in the plugin directory.

= Automatic Twitter links =

This plugin also includes a configurable & improved version of my earlier Automatic Twitter Links plugin. You can decide if you want to convert Twitter names and/or hashtags to links. 
Twitter names will link to their Twitter profile and hashtags will link to the Twitter search page.

== Installation ==

Upload the Social Sharing Toolkit plugin to your blog, activate it and use the Social Sharing Toolkit page under Settings to configure your toolkit.
